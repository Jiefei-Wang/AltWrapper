Description: 
    The package is designed for reducing the learning curve of ALTREP and 
    facilitating development of ALTREP-related packages. It provides a set of
    functions to manage user-defined ALTREP classes at the R level. Defining an ALTREP
    function is informal and ad hoc. There is no C/C++ code involved for defining 
    an ALTREP function and the function can be redefined at any time.
    Users are expected to call setAltClass to define the class name and 
    type first. Then calling setAltMethod to define the behavior of an ALTREP
    class. Finally an ALTREP object can be made by calling newAltrep.
