Description: 
    The package is designed for facilitating development of ALTREP-related 
    packages. It provides a set of functions to define and manage an ALTREP 
    class in purely R level. Defining an ALTREP
    function is informal and ad hoc. There is no compilation for defining 
    an ALTREP function and the function can be redefined at any time.
    Users are expected to call setAltClass to define the class name and 
    type first. Then calling setAltMethod to define the behavior of an ALTREP
    class. Finally an ALTREP object can be made by calling makeAltrep.
